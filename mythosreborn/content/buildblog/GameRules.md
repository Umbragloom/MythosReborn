Welcome to Mythos Reborn, a tabletop god builder game. You play a cult leader
that is trying to raise one of your gods, before the other cult leaders do.

You traverse the world gathering your totems pieces while evading the fence,
traps set by others, natural disasters, and other delays. 

Once your god, or gods, totems are built, the end of times begin and soon the
apocalypse is upon you!
