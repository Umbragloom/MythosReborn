# Welcome!

---
Initial Design of game has begun on 8-25-2022. Initial designs include:

 
1. Game Rules and Mechanics.
2. Game Lore.
3. Game Overview.

---

# [Game Rules and Mechnics]({{< ref "/buildblog/GameRules.md" >}} "Game Rules and Mechanics")

---

Initial rules and mechanics for most main components have been written down
and laid out for review.

# [Game Lore]({{< ref "/buildblog/GameLore.md" >}} "Game Lore")

---

Game lore will be based in both fantasy and real world. The map will be the
real world, but the gods, cult leaders, and factions will be fantasy. Game
Lore will be both obscure and vague to allow for the imagination to be key
in the major parts of the games build-a-god design, but allow an
interesting prebuilt world if players so choose.

# Game Overview

---

This is the simple overview that will be provided on the game box. 

---

More to come in the future.
