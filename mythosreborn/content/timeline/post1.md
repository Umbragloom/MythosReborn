# Hi there

Let me introduce myself: I am Josh Mathie, I have been a lover of all
types of table top games, board games, and fantasy since i could read! 

I decided to try designing a board game and this is my design website for it. Here I will update information on the concepts and design process of my game. 

Ill try to post information about my game as I design it!
