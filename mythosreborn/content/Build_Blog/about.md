Welcome to Mythos Reborn, A little bit about me before we get into what this
even is. 

My name is Joshua Mathie, I have loved tabletop, card, and board games since I was a kid,
growing up playing games like Yatzee, UNO, Chess, Clue, and Candyland. Once I got
older I was introduced to other board games such as Lifeboat, Catan,
Ticket-to-ride, and mansions of madness, as well as being introduced to Table
Top RPG's such as Dungeons and Dragons (3.5 back when I got started) Pathfinder, and Vampire The Masquerade. 

Ever since I started playing boardgames and tabletop games, i've always waned
to design a game. Something that i've always wanted in a game, but couldn't
really get in just one game. 

So this is my website for just that. Showing how i go about designing concepts
of the game, giving lore to the story, and making something fun for everyone!

Hope you enjoy Mythos Reborn and one day get to play it!!
